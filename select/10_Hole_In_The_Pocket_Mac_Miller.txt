Ayye turn my beat up a bit Yo for real
Or is it gonna get louder
Alright cool
She keep getting played like it's recess
Break her heart it's a reflex
Wanna hit the beach
And show her ties
Down in Key West
Someone leave her crying all the time
Now she find me out a Kleenex
Sick of dudes not giving her the respect
But really she's a genius
A CEO
Trying be on top
But whoa she don't keep them clothes
She be waiting for the opportunity to be the boss
Tough bitch
Probably would've thought she played lacrosse
He keep being soft with her Heart broken all the time
Once a money to fucking dude And falling
All in love with who is nothing new
Only coming through
Bust a nut or two
She just need her family like the hugstable
And now she on the road After home to take over
Get rich
And have the crib made over But she gonna do the partying
With a cup full
Ain't gonna trust you
But she gonna fuck you
She wants diamonds
She wants gold
But she is scandalous
Get to blow
And she's been high
And she's been low
And now she fighting on my own
And they be looking
And they be finding
She ain't grindin'
She ain't hiding till she find her way back home
Till she find it all alone
She gonna be rich it's fuckin'
High school they were callin' her a slut
But now she comin' out with a Louis Vuitton and Juicy
On see the bitches be hating like whats up?
Cause they ain't doin' nothing
And she out here stuntin' Middle finger to the hoes
All them bitches had it coming yeah
On top of the world
She looking down
Invite you to the crib
Let you look around just a fucking tease
Trying get ya cheese
And invite you out to dinner cause she want to eat for free
She could pay if she wanted to
She wont though
Go home she got more dough
She wants diamonds
She wants gold
But she is scandalous
Get to blow
And shes been high
And shes been low
And now she fighting on my own
And they be looking
And they be finding
She ain't grinding
She ain't hiding
Till she find her way back home
Till she find it all alone
She wants diamonds
She wants gold
But she is scandalous
Get to blow
And shes been high
And shes been low
And now she fighting on my own
And they be looking
And they be finding
She ain't grinding
She ain't hiding
Till she find her way back home
Till she find it all alone
