```
The king said
"You're grounded for a while"
Such a nightmare
I've been waiting for today
to see you again
That's all I hoped for
Don't take my fun away
Think I can get by all alone
Just feel so bored to pieces
I don't want to see
the day pass me by
No, that's enough!
It's not like
I was scooped out with a knife
And it's not like
I was shot with a gun
and I got a hole in my heart
Hey, is someone there?
I need something to pick me up
But all I want to do is
see you
How long will this last?
Give me a break
I wanted to try
new clothes and shoes
Why don't things
work out as expected?
Oh I'm a Prince,
you know that's true?
I'm a Prince,
you know that's true?
The king said
"Just do as you're told"
What's on his mind?
If I only complied
I might have it made for life
But so what?
Don't take my fun away
Think I can get by all alone
Just feel so bored to pieces
I don't want to see
the day pass me by
No, that's enough!
It's not like
I was scooped out with a knife
And it’s not like
I was shot with a gun
and I got a hole in my heart
Hey, is someone there?
I need something to pick me up
But all I want to do is
see you
